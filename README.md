# Gnome navigation between workspaces using mouse

## requirements
> gnome

> xbindkeys

## tested on
> ubuntu 20.04

> Gnome 3.36

With these small scripts, it is possible to navigate between gnome workspaces using the combination of keyboard and mouse.

You can change the shortcut keys in ~ /.xbindkeysrc, by default, it will be: Alt + scrool of the mouse.

## installation
> download this repository, from execution permission to 'main.sh', with chmod + x main.sh.

> wait for the process to complete, the most time consuming part should be installing xbindkeys, and for that you need the root password, or sudo

this script will not download anything from an unknown source, the only download is from xbindkeys itself, directly from the distro repositories, using APT, if you have minimal knowledge of bash script, you can install it manually, following main.sh.
